- Discuss how to better make sure that work is done by Sunday evening when we want to merge to main
- Discuss time management and dealing with merge requests
- Possibly change code of conduct to include regular checks of merge requests

## Action points for next week (Scrum board)
- Finish must haves
- Prioritize the tasks for the week and distribute them asap (Tuesday/Wednesday)
- Start working on the multiplayer mode of the game
- Finish Singleplayer mode this week (which ends on 29 march), so we can allocate time for multiplayer/improvements as well
- Reminder for Assignment 5A (individual) - Deadline: April 1st

## Any other business / questions

## Questions for the TA
- Is there anything else we can do to improve our process grade? Are there any GitLab features we are not using (at all/correctly)?
- What should be our main take-away from the Git Inspector results? How should we change our work distribution?
- Is there a fixed date when we are going to receive our grade from the HCI report?
